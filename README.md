# signal
An implementation of the card game - The Mind, and playing with HTMX and KTOR

The idea is to use htmx with a ktor backend to implement a basic number card game across multiple clients.


Note: I forgot that it wasn't called 'signal' and that signal actually refers to a different card game. Oh well, this implementation will be called 'signal' for the card game 'The Mind'.
